# Mood Detection with OpenCV

This project aims to implement a face and mood recognition system using computer vision techniques. The system has the following functionalities:

Face Recognition: The system can recognize whether a detected face belongs to the user or not. It uses a trained model to distinguish between known faces and unknown faces.

Mood Recognition: The system is capable of recognizing the mood of the user's face, specifically detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or confusion. It uses DeepFace library to analyze facial expressions and infer emotions.
