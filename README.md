# Mood Detection with OpenCV

This project aims to implement a face and mood recognition system using computer vision techniques. The system has the following functionalities:

Face Recognition: The system can recognize whether a detected face belongs to the user or not. It uses a trained model to distinguish between known faces and unknown faces.

Mood Recognition: The system is capable of recognizing the mood of the user's face, specifically detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or confusion. It uses DeepFace library to analyze facial expressions and infer emotions.

* Face Recognition Model
  > The facial recognition model uses pre-trained models to analyze video frames captured from the webcam, identifying my face among other 4 people in the dataset.

* Mood Detector Model
  > The mood detector model, powered by DeepFace, analyzes live video feeds from the webcam, swiftly identifying emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, confusion, or any other emotions displayed by individuals. This straightforward tool enables users to assess the prevailing mood within their surroundings effortlessly.
